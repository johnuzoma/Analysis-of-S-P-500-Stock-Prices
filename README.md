### Executive summary
This is a project where I used SQL to analyse S&P 500 stock prices. 
The database I used was SQL Server 2019 and developmentr environment was SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Techniques used include: subqueries, joins, aggregations, common table expressions, numeric and strring functions.

### Business questions
1. Which date in the sample saw the largest overall trading volume?
2. On that date, which two stocks were traded most?
3. On which day of the week does volume tend to be highest?
4. On which day of the week does volume tend to be lowest?
5. On which date did Amazon (AMZN) see the most volatility, measured by the difference between the high and low price?
6. If you could go back in time and invest in one stock from 1/2/2014 - 12/29/2017, which would you choose?
7. What % gain would you realize?

### Insights from analysis
1. The largest trading volume occurred on Feb 24, 2014.
2. On that date, Verizon and Bank of America stocks were traded most with volumes of approximately 618 million and 103 million respectively.
3. On average, Friday was the weekday with the highest volume.
4. On average, Monday was the weekday with the lowest volume.
5. The Amazon stock had the most volatility (~86) on June 9, 2017.
